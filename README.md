Experimenting with PJRC Teensy prop shield

First try at using the Teensy Prop shield to make sound effects akin to those from a famous franchise featuring glowing swords.

Current outcome is a hum that modulates with angular changes, and a strike effect on abrupt changes.

Heavy use of floating point which is not yet impacting performance but will probably contstrain extension without some refactoring.
